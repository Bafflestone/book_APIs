# book_APIs

# This project contains a set of 3 python scripts containing functions that interact with the https://jsonapiplayground.reyesoft.com/v2/authors endpoint. 
# I have used the requests, json and unittest library as a demonstration of how to get information via requests.get and interact with it in Python.
